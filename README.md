1) make a VM in Azure and login
2) generate a Monoro wallet 
3) SSH in Terminal 
4) comm: nano mine.sh
5) I have the shell code above paste it and also change the address if not possible visit this website and change the last command (https://xmrig.com/wizard#result)
6) Change the permission to executable command: chmod +x mine.sh
7) then run the shell command: ./mine.sh
8) get the wallet address and past in this website to see the h/s and if the miner is mining or not (https://web.xmrpool.eu/) as it is mining pool
9) then see the total income on this this website add manually (https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/xmr?HashingPower=1&HashingUnit=KH%2Fs&PowerConsumption=0&CostPerkWh=0.12&MiningPoolFee=)
10) So hence hash is 2.6 kh/s so no money
